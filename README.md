# tcf_dio

This project was originally create at the end of 2021 and is a quick (rough) prototype of a concept I had to help further my knowledge of flutter and dart.

that leverages the SugarWOD API.

Packages of interest used in this project from a learning stand point: dartz, equatable, flutter_bloc, http, intl
